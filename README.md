# Desi Royale

**Desi Royale** is a multiplayer survival game rooted in childhood nostalgia, where players relive the thrill, excitement, and fear of trying to finish their chores while evading an angered parent. Inspired by *Dead by Daylight* and everyday childhood experiences, this unique game pits two teams—*children* versus *mothers*—against each other in a frantic battle of wits and speed.

## 🕹️ Gameplay Overview

In **Desi Royale**, players choose between two roles:
- **Children:** Sneak around the house or neighborhood completing chores, all while evading the ever-watchful mothers. The goal is to finish all tasks before being captured!
- **Mothers:** Your job is to stop the children from finishing their chores. Use strategy, slippers, and your intuition to catch them before they get away.

### Key Mechanics:
- **Slipper Throwing (Chappal):** Mothers can throw slippers (chappals) at children. If a child is hit, they are stunned, allowing the mother to grab them and drag them to their father.
- **Task-Based Play:** Children must complete a series of randomly assigned chores, like washing dishes, cleaning rooms, or watering plants, while avoiding the mothers’ detection.
- **Cultural Nostalgia:** Tap into the classic, relatable tension of avoiding chores and an angry parent, with a comedic twist.

## 🎮 Game Modes

- **Multiplayer (PvP):** 2-8 players divided into two teams: *children* and *mothers*. Play with friends in this unique, cultural hide-and-seek style game.
- **Customizable Settings:** Adjust the number of chores, difficulty levels, and the slipper-throwing accuracy for added challenge and fun.

## 🏠 Chores

Children will be tasked with completing randomly assigned chores, including but not limited to:
- **Washing dishes**
- **Cleaning up rooms**
- **Folding laundry**
- **Watering plants**

These tasks must be completed while evading the mothers and their slipper attacks!

## 👩‍👧 Team Roles

- **Children:**
  - Complete chores while hiding from mothers.
  - Work together to distract mothers, finish tasks, or rescue teammates.
  
- **Mothers:**
  - Throw slippers to stun children, catch them, and drag them to their father.
